## Description

This repository has three mini-projects;
~A student grade calculator project.
~A speed detector project.
~A Net Salary Calculator project.

## Student Grade Calculator Project.

It's a program that grades student marks.
It makes sure to grade marks only between 0-100.

JavaScript function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40

## Speed Detector

JavaScript program that takes the speed of a car as input (in km/h). If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it should print "Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program should print "License suspended."

This program checks the speed of a car and prints "OK" if the speed of the car is less than the speed limit.
The program will otherwise print the demerit points and terminate the license of a drivers who goes above the speed limit.

## Net Salary Calculator
